Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for building NLP applications using PyTorch. It covers:

Data processing: cleaning, feature extraction, and embedding generation.
Model development: intent classification, semantic search, and text generation.
Evaluation: assessing model performance using various metrics.
Testing: ensuring code reliability through unit and integration tests.

Data Processing
The data pipeline includes:

Cleaning Data: Removing noise, handling missing values, and normalizing text.
Feature Extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features.
Embeddings: Generating word or sentence embeddings using models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT.
Scripts are located in data_processing/.

Models
Intent Classification
Models that classify user intents from text inputs using techniques like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.

Directory: models/intent_classification/
Semantic Search
Models that enable semantic similarity search between texts using embedding spaces.

Directory: models/semantic_search/
Text Generation
Models capable of generating contextually relevant text, built upon architectures like GPT.

Directory: models/text_generation/
Evaluation
Scripts and tools for evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and BLEU score.

Directory: evaluation/
Testing
Ensures code reliability and correctness.

Unit Tests: Test individual components.

Integration Tests: Test interactions between components.
